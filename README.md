# Methane Detection UI

## Overview

The Methane Detection UI is a web-based application designed to visualize methane concentrations across various locations. Utilizing interactive graphs and maps, this tool aims to provide a user-friendly interface for analyzing and understanding methane levels, which is crucial for environmental monitoring and research.

## Features

- **Interactive Graphs**: Includes line and bar graphs to display methane concentration trends over time.
- **Dynamic Mapping**: Integrates an interactive map to visualize methane concentrations geographically.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures a seamless user experience across various devices and screen sizes.

## Technologies

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: An open-source language which builds on JavaScript by adding static type definitions.
- **Leaflet**: An open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps.
- **Chart.js**: Simple yet flexible JavaScript charting for designers & developers.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)
